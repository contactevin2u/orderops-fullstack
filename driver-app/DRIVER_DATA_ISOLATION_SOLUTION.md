# Driver Data Isolation Solution

## Problem
When multiple drivers use the same device, local Room database retains data from previous drivers, causing:
- **Data Leakage**: New drivers see orders/data from previous drivers
- **Operational Confusion**: Drivers cannot complete or update orders not assigned to them
- **Security Risk**: Sensitive customer/order information exposed to wrong drivers

## Implemented Solution

### 1. Data Clearing Service ✅
Created `DataClearingService.kt` that clears all local data:
- Jobs/Orders
- Outbox pending operations
- Photos
- UID scans
- Location pings

### 2. Enhanced AuthService ✅
Modified `AuthService.kt` to automatically clear data:
- **On Sign In**: Clear existing data before new driver login
- **On Sign Out**: Clear all data when driver logs out

### 3. Updated DAOs ✅
Added `deleteAll()` methods to all DAO interfaces:
- `JobsDao`
- `OutboxDao` 
- `PhotosDao`
- `UIDScansDao`
- `LocationPingDao`

### 4. AuthViewModel Integration ✅
Added proper logout functionality with data clearing

## How It Works

1. **Driver A logs in**: 
   - Previous data cleared automatically
   - Driver A sees only their assigned orders

2. **Driver A logs out**:
   - All local data cleared
   - Device ready for next driver

3. **Driver B logs in**:
   - Clean slate - no previous data
   - Only Driver B's orders loaded

## Future Enhancement: Driver ID Tracking

For additional security, consider adding `driver_id` to entities:

```kotlin
@Entity(tableName = "jobs")
data class JobEntity(
    // existing fields...
    val driverId: Int, // Add this field
    // other fields...
)
```

This would allow:
- Driver-specific data filtering
- Selective data clearing
- Better audit trails

## Implementation Files Modified

1. `DataClearingService.kt` - New service for clearing data
2. `AuthService.kt` - Enhanced with data clearing
3. `AuthViewModel.kt` - Added proper logout
4. `JobsDao.kt` - Already had `deleteAll()`
5. `OutboxDao.kt` - Added `deleteAll()`
6. `PhotosDao.kt` - Added `deleteAll()`
7. `UIDScansDao.kt` - Added `deleteAll()`
8. `LocationPing.kt` - Added `deleteAll()` to DAO

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with Driver A, verify orders appear
- [ ] Login with Driver B on same device, verify no Driver A orders
- [ ] Logout and login again, verify clean data state
- [ ] Check outbox clearing works properly
- [ ] Verify photos and scans are cleared

## Security Benefits

✅ **Data Isolation**: Each driver only sees their own data
✅ **Privacy Protection**: Previous driver data completely removed
✅ **Operational Clarity**: No confusion from mixed driver data
✅ **Compliance**: Meets data privacy requirements
