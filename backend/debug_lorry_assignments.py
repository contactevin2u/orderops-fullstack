DEBUGGING LORRY-DRIVER MISMATCH ISSUE
=====================================

Issue: Stock loaded to lorry VEA8621 but not showing for drivers
Root Cause: Missing LorryAssignment linking drivers to lorries

Expected Flow:
Driver → LorryAssignment → Lorry → Stock

Let's check what's missing:
""")

print("1. Check if any LorryAssignment records exist")
print("2. Check if Driver 1/17 have assignments to VEA8621")  
print("3. Check if VEA8621 has stock transactions")
print("4. Suggest fixes for the missing link")

print("""
SOLUTION OPTIONS:
================

A. Create missing LorryAssignment records
B. Modify driver stock endpoint to show ALL lorries' stock
C. Add fallback to show stock for drivers without assignments

This explains why:
✅ Stock loading works (creates LorryStockTransaction)
❌ Driver stock empty (no LorryAssignment linking driver→lorry)
