# OrderOps - Complete Order Management System

A comprehensive full-stack order management system with automated AI assignment, real-time inventory tracking, and integrated financial processing. Built for Malaysian logistics operations with offline-first mobile capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

**3-Tier Full-Stack Application:**
- **Backend**: FastAPI with PostgreSQL, OpenAI-powered routing, Firebase integration
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with Tailwind CSS, React Query, TypeScript
- **Mobile**: Android Kotlin app with Jetpack Compose, offline-first architecture

## 🔄 Complete Order Flow

### 1. **ORDER PARSING STAGE** (`/parse/*`)

**4-Stage LLM Classification Pipeline:**
- **Stage 1**: Text input parsing (WhatsApp messages, manual input)  
- **Stage 2**: Order type identification (OUTRIGHT | INSTALLMENT | RENTAL | MIXED)
- **Stage 3**: Status determination (NEW | ACTIVE | RETURNED | CANCELLED | COMPLETED)
- **Stage 4**: Financial category classification (ORDER | RENTAL | INSTALLMENT | PENALTY | DELIVERY | BUYBACK)

**Processing Branches:**
```
Input → Parse → {
  ├─ OUTRIGHT → Direct sale
  ├─ INSTALLMENT → Payment plan setup  
  ├─ RENTAL → Recurring billing
  ├─ MIXED → Hybrid approach
  └─ ADJUSTMENT → Return/Buyback/Cancellation
}
```

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /parse/advanced` - Full 4-stage LLM parsing
- `POST /parse/classify` - Message classification only
- `POST /parse/quotation` - Quotation parsing
- `POST /parse/find-order` - Mother order lookup

### 2. **ORDER CREATION & RECORDING** (`/orders/*`)

**Data Flow:**
- Customer creation/lookup with deduplication
- Order record with Decimal precision financial calculations
- Item breakdown and pricing with line totals
- Payment plan setup (installments/rentals)
- Idempotency handling for duplicate prevention

**Financial Precision:**
```python
subtotal: Decimal = Decimal("0.00")  # 12,2 precision
total: Decimal = calculated_subtotal + delivery_fee - discount
balance: Decimal = total - paid_amount
```

### 3. **🤖 FULLY AUTOMATED AI ASSIGNMENT**

**CRITICAL**: Every order creation **automatically triggers** PhD-level AI assignment:

```python
# Triggered immediately after order creation
trigger_auto_assignment(db, order.id)
  ↓
AssignmentService.auto_assign_all()
  ↓ 
GPT-4 PhD-level route optimization
```

**Assignment Intelligence:**
- **Driver Selection**: ONLY scheduled drivers (DriverSchedule integration)
- **Priority System**: Clocked-in > Scheduled > Workload balancing
- **Geographic AI**: Malaysian logistics expertise (Plus Highway, state corridors)
- **Route Optimization**: Multi-depot vehicle routing (MD-VRP) algorithms
- **Real-time**: Both synchronous assignment + background queue processing

**AI Optimization Features:**
- **Route Clustering**: North/South/East corridor grouping
- **Fuel Efficiency**: Minimizes total fleet costs and driver hours  
- **Area Familiarity**: Uses driver delivery history for optimal assignment
- **Sabah Logistics**: Separate Kota Kinabalu base coordination

### 4. **DRIVER APP INTEGRATION** 📱

**Real-time Driver Journey:**
- **Clock System**: In/out tracking with outstation detection
- **Job Management**: Real-time order retrieval and status updates
- **Location Services**: GPS pinging with accuracy tracking
- **Order Progression**: Status updates (ASSIGNED → IN_TRANSIT → DELIVERED)
- **POD System**: Multiple proof-of-delivery photos
- **Stock Reconciliation**: `/drivers/{id}/lorry-stock/{date}` integration

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- Outbox pattern with exponential backoff retry
- AsyncStorage-backed request queuing
- Firebase integration (messaging, analytics, crashlytics)
- Automatic connectivity restoration

### 5. **DELIVERY EXECUTION & STATUS MANAGEMENT**

**Status Progression:**
```
NEW → ASSIGNED → IN_TRANSIT → {
  ├─ DELIVERED → Success path → Commission calculation
  ├─ RETURNED → Failed delivery → Return processing
  ├─ ON_HOLD → Customer issues → Hold management
  └─ CANCELLED → Order cancellation → Adjustment handling
}
```

**Advanced Features:**
- **Upsell During Delivery**: Driver-initiated item upgrades
- **Dynamic Hold Management**: Customer issue resolution
- **Return Processing**: Automated adjustment order creation
- **Real-time Tracking**: Location and status monitoring

### 6. **ENHANCED UID INVENTORY SYSTEM** 📦

**7-Action Lifecycle Management:**
```
Order → UID Actions → {
  ├─ LOAD_OUT → Driver takes inventory from warehouse
  ├─ DELIVER → Customer receives items (with POD)
  ├─ RETURN → Items returned from customer  
  ├─ REPAIR → Maintenance/service required
  ├─ SWAP → Item exchange during delivery
  ├─ LOAD_IN → Items returned to warehouse
  └─ ISSUE → Problem/damage reporting
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Driver App**: Real-time UID scanning with order linking
- **Backend**: `/inventory/uid/scan` with enhanced action support
- **SKU Resolution**: Fuzzy matching and alias support
- **Stock Reconciliation**: Daily driver stock verification
- **Item Tracking**: Current location and status per UID

### 7. **FINANCIAL BACKBONE & ACCRUALS** 💰

**Precision Financial System:**
- **Decimal Arithmetic**: All monetary calculations use Decimal(12,2)
- **Commission System**: PENDING → ACTUALIZED workflow
- **Accrual Accuracy**: Proper monthly calculation and tracking
- **Multi-category Support**: ORDER/RENTAL/INSTALLMENT/PENALTY/DELIVERY/BUYBACK

**Commission Flow:**
```
Order Completion → Commission Calculation → {
  ├─ Pending State → Awaiting actualization conditions
  ├─ Actualized → Commission released to driver
  └─ Scheme-based → Rate calculation (flat/percentage)
}
```

**Export & Reconciliation:**
- Cash payment export with run tracking
- Rollback capabilities for export corrections
- QR code receipt generation
- Invoice PDF generation at `/orders/{id}/invoice.pdf`

### 8. **PAYMENT RECORDING & CATEGORIZATION**

**Payment Categories:**
- **ORDER**: Direct order payments
- **RENTAL**: Monthly rental fees  
- **INSTALLMENT**: Scheduled payment plan payments
- **PENALTY**: Late fees and penalties
- **DELIVERY**: Delivery and logistics charges
