# Render Cloud Deployment Guide

## Migration Status ✅

The database schema is ready for deployment with the following migration chain:

```
a3c70e9437fe (merge_heads) 
  ↓
drv_base_wh (driver_base_warehouse)

5852c5f76a34 (uid_inventory_system)
  ↓
c4f8e2a91b12 (enhance_uid_system) ← CURRENT HEAD
```

**No migration conflicts detected** - ready for `alembic upgrade head`

## Order Flow Integration Status ✅

### 1. **Parsing Stage** (4-Stage Classification)
- ✅ `/parse/advanced` - Full LLM parsing pipeline  
- ✅ `/parse/classify` - Message classification (DELIVERY/RETURN)
- ✅ `/parse/quotation` - Quotation parsing
- ✅ `/parse/find-order` - Mother order identification
- **Branches**: OUTRIGHT | INSTALLMENT | RENTAL | MIXED | ADJUSTMENT

### 2. **Order Creation & Recording**
- ✅ Customer creation/lookup
- ✅ Order record with financial calculations (Decimal precision)
- ✅ Item breakdown and pricing
- ✅ Plan setup (installments/rentals)
- ✅ Idempotency handling
- **States**: NEW → ACTIVE → DELIVERED/RETURNED/CANCELLED → COMPLETED

### 3. **Driver Assignment Flow**
- ✅ AI-powered assignment suggestions (`/ai-assignments/suggestions`)
- ✅ Manual assignment (`/ai-assignments/apply`) 
- ✅ Bulk accept all (`/ai-assignments/accept-all`)
- ✅ Available drivers tracking
- ✅ Distance-based optimization

### 4. **Driver App Integration** 📱
- ✅ Order status updates
- ✅ Location tracking and pings
- ✅ POD photo uploads (multiple photos supported)
- ✅ Clock in/out system with shift tracking
- ✅ Upsell functionality during delivery
- ✅ **Stock reconciliation**: `/drivers/{id}/lorry-stock/{date}`

### 5. **Enhanced UID Inventory System** 📦
- ✅ **7 Action Types**: LOAD_OUT, DELIVER, RETURN, REPAIR, SWAP, LOAD_IN, ISSUE
- ✅ UID scanning with order item tracking  
- ✅ SKU resolution with fuzzy matching
- ✅ Lorry stock reconciliation
- ✅ Item lifecycle management
- ✅ **Full integration** between driver app ↔ backend

### 6. **Financial Backbone** 💰
- ✅ **Decimal precision** for all monetary calculations
- ✅ Commission system: PENDING → ACTUALIZED flow
- ✅ Payment recording with categories:
  - ORDER | RENTAL | INSTALLMENT | PENALTY | DELIVERY | BUYBACK
- ✅ Export functionality with run tracking
- ✅ Accrual accuracy with proper monthly calculations

### 7. **Payment & Receipt System**
- ✅ Payment recording with export tracking
- ✅ Invoice PDF generation
- ✅ QR code support in receipts
- ✅ Cash payment export with rollback capability
